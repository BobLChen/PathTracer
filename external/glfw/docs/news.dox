@section news_34 Release notes for version 3.4

@subsection features_34 New features in version 3.4

@subsubsection standard_cursors_34 More standard cursors

GLFW now provides the standard cursor shapes @ref GLFW_RESIZE_NWSE_CURSOR and
@ref GLFW_RESIZE_NESW_CURSOR for diagonal resizing, @ref GLFW_RESIZE_ALL_CURSOR
for omni-directional resizing and @ref GLFW_NOT_ALLOWED_CURSOR for showing an
action is not allowed.

Unlike the original set, these shapes may not be available everywhere and
creation will then fail with the new @ref GLFW_CURSOR_UNAVAILABLE error.

The cursors for horizontal and vertical resizing are now referred to as @ref
GLFW_RESIZE_EW_CURSOR and @ref GLFW_RESIZE_NS_CURSOR, and the pointing hand
cursor is now referred to as @ref GLFW_POINTING_HAND_CURSOR.  The older names
are still available.

For more information see @ref cursor_standard.


@subsubsection features_34_win32_keymenu Support for keyboard access to Windows window menu

GLFW now provides the
[GLFW_WIN32_KEYBOARD_MENU](@ref GLFW_WIN32_KEYBOARD_MENU_hint) window hint for
enabling keyboard access to the window menu via the Alt+Space and
Alt-and-then-Space shortcuts.  This may be useful for more GUI-oriented
applications.


@subsection caveats_34 Caveats for version 3.4

@subsubsection standalone_34 Tests and examples are disabled when built as a sub-project

GLFW now does not build the tests and examples when it is added as
a subdirectory of another CMake project.  To enable these, set the @ref
GLFW_BUILD_TESTS and @ref GLFW_BUILD_EXAMPLES cache variables before adding the
GLFW subdirectory.

@code{.cmake}
set(GLFW_BUILD_EXAMPLES ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(GLFW_BUILD_TESTS ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(path/to/glfw)
@endcode


@subsubsection initmenu_34 macOS main menu now created at initialization

GLFW now creates the main menu and completes the initialization of NSApplication
during initialization.  Programs that do not want a main menu can disable it
with the [GLFW_COCOA_MENUBAR](@ref GLFW_COCOA_MENUBAR_hint) init hint.


@subsubsection corevideo_34 CoreVideo dependency has been removed

GLFW no longer depends on the CoreVideo framework on macOS and it no longer
needs to be specified during compilation or linking.


@subsection deprecations_34 Deprecations in version 3.4

@subsection removals_34 Removals in 3.4

@subsubsection wl_shell_34 Support for the wl_shell protocol has been removed

Support for the wl_shell protocol has been removed and GLFW now only supports
the XDG-Shell protocol.  If your Wayland compositor does not support XDG-Shell
then GLFW will fail to initialize.


@subsection symbols_34 New symbols in version 3.4
