INTRODUCTION
The sole purpose of this class is to load a file and extract the text that is in it.
In theory, this class could be used for a variety of text-processing purposes, but
it was initially designed to be used to load shader source code.

USING THIS CLASS
Since the entire class is a static class, you only have to add this single line of
code to your project:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
std::string shaderSource = Shadinclude::load("./path/to/shader.extension");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will (recursively) extract the source code from the first shader file.
Now, you might be wondering, what is the point of using your code for something
so trivial as to loading a file and calling the "std::getline()" function on it?

Well, besides loading the shader source code from a single file, the loader also
supports custom keywords that allow you to include external files inside your
shader source code!

PARAMETERS OF THE LOAD FUNCTION
- std::string	path				path to the "main" shader file
- std::string	includeIdentifier	keyword to look for when scanning for files

MISCELLANEOUS
- Author	:	Tahar Meijs
- Date		:	10th - 12th of April 2018
- Language	:	C++ (can easily be converted into other languages)
